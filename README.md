# NY-Airbnb-Data-Analysis

Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California.

Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

The company has been criticized for a direct correlation between increases in the number of its listings and increases in nearby rent prices, and creating nuisances for those living near leased properties.

The company is regulated by many jurisdictions, including the European Union and cities such as San Francisco and New York City. It is viewed as a competitive threat by the hotel industry



Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.
